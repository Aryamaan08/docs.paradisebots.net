 ## Introduction.
 Paradise is The Discord Bot List that strives to provide all Discord Bots & Bot Devs With a little bit of Freedom!!

---

 ## Our Focus
 A Discord Bot Lists purpose is to allow Developers to Advertise their Bot for other people to use (No strings attached)
 We allow you to do just that, Now days we see <strong>way to many</strong> Bot Lists who focus to much on Policing the T.O.S. No offence of course to the good Bot Lists (You lnow who you are)
 The only "Term" we "police" is where your Bot posts NSFW Content if any (NSFW Channels only)
